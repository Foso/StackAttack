Board Flip issues:

flipping row on deck flickers for one frame (upon start)

Flip Board Timer, dont allow unless time has passed (1 sec?)

Board settles upsidedown off by one row. (flip back and forth on a full board).. related to board increment reference

========================================================================================================================

orientation, tilt board via accel? Where will i use this? How will it help?

Change renderer to not redraw on stale information (via GLUpdater timestamp)

Add general animation pause??

========================================================================================================================

BUGS:

	Settle-Dropblock race condition, leaves drawable above the virtal block

	Generate Garbage not placing blocks in the right spot. Check methods for correct column placement

X	After a long time of playing, the bottom of the board moves up a little at a time. Seems to be a problem determining the block length?

	Race condition: drawable and grid location are out of sync, for an instant (flicker on board increment). 

	End of game pause timer not working when melting occurs (keeps counting?)

	Finger down is a bad event for invalidating the score multiplier... get another one...

X?	Generate garbage moves board even when no garbage was generated (board was full)
	
	Garbage Blocks drop from below? need new equation for dropping.... no spring!
	
	Garbage block wrapper normals not right... fix for normal lighting!
		
	Swap around corner of garbage works even though there is not space
	
	


========================================================================================================================

FEATURES:

	Moving light source.... would be awesome

	END OF LEVEL/GAME: make a given match pattern / color sequence to destroy the current board (only one of multiple). then level up

	Twist game board while destroy board animation is happeneing :) (awesome)

X	Pick up block , wobble back and forth

X	Melting block memebers shoudl buldge bigger than 1.0 and go back down to 1.0

	Increase block mesh count, determine if the lighting can be improved

X	HOW TO ENSURE SWAP BLOCK TRANSACTION???? SETTLE-SWAP-DELETE-INCREMENT syncing
X	... "synchronized methods" for most board transactions

	Easy medium, hard: game play will be a little different for each (pause on match, hold board iteration on pickup     vs.   not :)   )

	Generate board sized based on screen resolution... a block souldn't be smaller than YxY pixels or bigger than... 

	Flip Board

	Mind f* rule: reverse board (play from behind)

	Multi-Layer Board?

	special blocks
	
X	Entire board shakes like spring when garbage is dropped! (like real crack attack)

========================================================================================================================

General Idea:
	Various modes of playing (infinite, leveled, bonus, insane, easy-med-hard...) ; like firefight vs multiplayer vs custom game
	Implement playable game for one person (level up & termination of game)
	Add multiplayer support
X	Add multiple boards
	Add flipping boards
	EOG countdown timer

========================================================================================================================

MENUS:   See google docs

========================================================================================================================


implement:
X	row on deck + lock before incrementing board 					...		lock not needed
X	Add row to bottom of board, getRow() still works				...		no action
X	increment row speed pickups (every min or so / over X rows)???	...		Every 30 seconds
X	game over timing & destruction

X	...then groups
X	Garbage blocks
X	Settling Garbage!
X	Matching + Animation
X	Destroying garbage (gracefully): make inner blocks invisible until the garbage melts
X	Matching next to garbage
X	Scoring: matches, multipliers, combos  (no board, just debug)
X	Garbage Generation based on block matching, not iterations (once at random time between 20 & 60 seconds, also based on cumulative settle score greater than 3)
		Block matches above 3 blocks = # blocks matches (minus the base of 3 blocks) Times current multiplier
		General Match = 0.1 gen points
		At random time between 20 & 60 seconds: Garbage Generation Event:
			Add a single garbage point (for time passing)
			Check if above X total points, if so... generate. Otherwise wait.
	
X	Moving block should never trigger settle when settle is disabled

X?	Settle Bugs:
X?		- Random groups don't settle properly (members become astray). BECAUSE: garbage members are colocating in overlapped positions
X		- melting adjacent groups causes last group to get settled separately (should all settle together)
X		HELP: Implement game.eventlog & game.err. These should be two panes (left & right). event shows major board events increment, pause resume, swap, settle.
X				game.err should be for watched parts (settle errors, swap errors)
X		- Try Catch around matching/deleting, add to game.err. Sometimes after a match, the block is still there!		
X			IDEA: These are not settle bugs, I have problems syncing delete block. I either keep the drawable or the grid element. or they get out of sync (pos)
X			GENERATE garbage is causing these issues!
							
	Garbage should stack above board? can't! different interface
		Instead, upon a failed garbage generation, another "immediateGenQueue" points should be incremented. If this is above 0, the end of game countdown
		should be started. As soon as the garbage can be generated, it should be (continuously emptying the queue)
		
		or 
		
		Garbage stacks in Z-space
		
X	Grey Garbage vs. Red Garbage. Red transmits melting, Grey Doesn't.
X	Check for match on block swap (checking the blocks swapped and adjacent colors, growing outwards). This will implements a realtime matching (say when
		there is melting so a settle cannot be triggered but the user makes a manual match in the meantime. This makes the manual match realtime instead
		of waiting for a settle).
	
X	Why are groups falling out of order... they should be staggered. ... (fixed programatic delay)
	
X	Make "SettleBelowRow" for fixing melting while the player continues to play below the melting...
X		INSTEAD: implement "freeze" block (group?), so it cannot be settled anywhere. ANything melting should be frozen. The board will always be settled
	
X	Delete group membership for melting blocks & trigger interactable upon NEXT SETTLE? Keeps groups from settling out of sync and users from 
X		moving newly melted blocks. Add any groups to get stripped to a list, upon settle, strip groups first (not in block update)


NO	( [enable this from the activity if you want...]
		X	Re-introduce board flipping?
		X		Augment GenerateGarbage()
		X		Augment RelocateROD()
		X		Augment AnimationBroker: queueAnimation: SpawnROWOnDeck?
		X		Augment Animation: SpawnROWOnDeck?
	)

	Main Menu:
X		Vertical Board orientation:	
X			Pause game via menu button, move 90 in rotation upwards
X			BUG: as board moves up, so does the center reference, this needs to be corrected
			
			TexFont: 	NO	Change to print() instead of printAt()
						X	Write PrintLeft() & PrintRight()
						NO	SetCurser() on ScoreBoard position change
							Try Different Fonts
			
			ScoreBoard:	X	Pickup
						X	Drag (follow)
						X	Pause
						X	Lift (roll up)
						NO	Animation (Use Broker!)
						X	Global Y Offset (For text & backdrop [& menu])
							Menu???
							Multi Menu
		

Bug fixing time!
X			flash of in-game menu on first drop down.
			Blocks jitter on drop/swap from previous location and transport to the new location (upon drop)?
?Better?	menu fps is 47 :(
			first app start or next game restart is jittery/slow, though fps seems fine... what's going on?
				First run: allocation, exit does not guarentee end of process. It may be reused!
				HOW DO I PREALLOCATE?
X			No ingame pause menu upon pressing home button then entering the app again
		
		
X		Scale fonts
		
X		On Invalid move = vibrate motor, flash block/background, shake block "no" fashion
		
X		Bug: quickly swap between two boards many times (or immediatly at start of game)... race condition: board flips vertically?? (knife point to screen/user)
		
X		Transformer Prime nonsense? any ideas?
X			ScoreBar: Proportion of rowxcol to empty space at top is larger than the block used to fill space..... so there is only half a score board
X			No GL11Ext? ... Nope, GL10 lighting not always supported with GL11Ext, turn off lighting when drawing HUD

X		Text							(orientation sensitive)
X		Score Board!!!!!				(orientation sensitive)
		
		Implement: 
		X	menu, 
		X	sub menus, 
			toggle buttons, 
			drop downs?, 
		X	number/value rollers + manipulators

X			Difficulty
		
		Finalize top banner with score & per mode play
		
X		BUG: Null Pointer Exception on Match of 6 (3, in 2 columns, next to one another)
X		BUG: Large resolution Screens: fonts have 1 PX of another letter!
X		BUG: two finger board manipulation should be disabled when on menus
X		BUG: After menu outro, the menu may show up again for a frame (at detent position) then vanish

X		BUG: Fix dragging blocks around corners (mindful of corners I can't get to)
X		BUG: wobble blocks disappear after getting off of the last row (drop down and gone? but still there) !
X		BUG: End of game timer sometimes does not release after clearing top row
X		BUG: match to make room on the board to increment row does not work!
X			matching blocks should'nd be counted in the top row (for isTopRowEmpty() in board)		
X		BUG: dont allow the user to go to boards that dont exist!		
X		BUG: Row increment: board to board it is not synced! causes board 0 to "skip" a row when adding the ROD to the board.
X		BUG: after a while of play, there is a Y offset that slowly moves up...
			Magic Solution: Board Manager; draw(); Line 961: scratchYOffset = mCurrentGLYOffset + (game.world.mGLBlockLength*0.9917f)*mCurrentGlobalRowIndex;
X		BUG: pause end of game timer upon melting garbage...
X		BUG: Settle still a little qwerky: sometimes (very very rarely) a block jumps up several positions
				Swap and Settle needed to cancel one anothers animations.
X		BUG: bonus block board progression resume overrides melting garbage board progression resume (should not happen)
X		BUG: reset the multiplier not upon interaction, but upon another match check that is unsuccessful (after match check occurs on event)
		Who Cares: BUG: should widget layer show up on every board in a duplicate fashion?
X		BUG: mutiple boards: when a bonus block is processing, then you switch to another board, you can keep the game artificaially paused
X		BUG: Pause game does not pause EOG timer
			Solution: Added locking to timers		
X		BUG: lock blocks that are mmatching due to bonus block match
X		BUG:  you make a T with 5 blocks you get 6 points
				Solution: impolemented hash set in coord()
X		BUG: Random Bomb / Color Bomb Bonus Blocks dont count towards largest match
			Decision: they should count! let the user use it strategically!
?		BUG: race condition with match + swap can leave a block in the grid but not in the block list
X		BUG: when upsidedown and increment board, goingn back to normal does not compensate for globalRowCounter. next increment upon normal overlays rows by -1
			Decision: upside down taken out	
X		BUG: Quit game button should skip game over sign.		
?		BUG: EOG Timer will not pause upon PauseGame when induced by another board
			Fixed with fake primary thread? (really secondary)
?		BUG: EOG timer does not re-check/resset when some blocks (bonus?) are done matching? especially when switchingn to another board. OR PAUSE BOARD PROGRESSION
			Fixed with fake primary thread? (really secondary)
?		BUG: too many points added on insane (and hard?).... maybe adding multiple boards?
			After game state tweak... gone?
?		BUG: matches should be smart to check contiguous blocks multiplier for statistics (compare against real crack attack to see what is displayed)
			Idea: event vs timed settle events.... what about per column?   <-- Tried that... did this cause any more bugs? dunno!		
?		BUG: sometimes garbage is not dropped but there is still a board sprin triggered?
			Not found! Maybe it was being generated on an adjacet board?
